This is the final project built for HCDE 438, Web Technologies. The project builds upon the UN sustainability goal of Life on Land, emphasizing sustainable practices to protect valuable resources such as trees and water. This project is heavily influenced by the idea of helping users limit their paper towel usage and is a continuation of a smart paper towel holder prototype made for another class.

As the companion app to said paper towel holder, this app tracks and alerts users of their usage patterns and can be customized to limit oneâ€™s weekly usage to reduce paper towel waste.

On the main screen, users will be able to view the status of their paper towel holder and see how many sheets is currently loaded.

From limit, users can see their weekly threshold for the quantity of paper towels they have used.

And from usage, users can also monitor how many sheets of paper towel they can use at once when tearing them off from the paper towel holder.

From the bottom navigation bar, users can also customize their personal goals in settings through changing threshold limits from the two sliders. Changes made will be reflected on the main screen for weekly limit and usage.

Finally, users can also navigate to the weekly information menu where they will be given statistics on their weekly usage compared to prior weeks as well as short and fun overviews that highlight the specifics such as the number of trees saved.
